        Many moons ago, a group of frisbee fans joined together to casually toss
        discs and play pickup games in Treptower Park. Little did they know that
        they would spark a movement that would spread far beyond the confines of
        that little park. Inspired by their love of the game, the rag tag group
        of aficionados banded together to form the Lobstars - a fun-loving,
        passionate, and international team celebrated in Berlin for their
        inclusivity and good spirit. Come play with us!
