        A group of ultimate frisbee fans joined together to toss discs and play
        pickup games in Treptower Park casually. Little did they know what they
        started would eventually stretch far beyond the confines of the park. In
        2022, inspired by the love of the game, the rag tag collection of
        players banded together to form Lobstars. We are a fun-loving,
        passionate, and international group valuing inclusivity and the spirit
        of the good game. Still a new team, we welcome all kinds of players and
        hope to build a stronger community as well as a competitive game. Come
        play with us!
