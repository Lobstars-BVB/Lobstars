Here is a great video going into the meaning of the word and also showing some great poaching examples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ulvRLCgT4

_TL;DW:_

The word poaching in ultimate refers to the original meaning "Hunting on someone elses property", which can be translated to ultimate "Defending where you should not be".
As you can see in the video examples, the poaches are quickly executed manouvers, where you stick to your assignment whilst keeping an eye on a dangerous place ([the offences strong space: we know this terminology from the ho-stack talks](https://ultiworld.com/2019/10/02/understanding-strong-weak-space-horizontal-stack/)), and only making a move into that space when its sure that the disc is going to pass through that space.

Poorly executed poaches, particularly those where you lose track of your original assignment and focus too mich on watching the more dangerous space, can backfire and lead to the offense getting a easy point. Both experienced and non-experienced teams with the eyes toward our end-zone will notice the free player and just throw it to them.

Learning to play heads-up(vigilanting the field) defence while still keeping close to your assignment, and being able to predict plays are key skills in how to being able to spot good poach opportunities

[Heres a poach analysis that goes through step by step how a great poach interception is executed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQNai1DQKcs). This example is happening on a transition from zone to person defense, maybe not the most common scenario but it still highlights the importance of having a matchup and keeping your head up and seeing the field.

#### Dragging away a poach

On the poach topic: how to make sure the other team cant poach.

Nr 66 in black notices his teammate Nr 15 going deep. You can see how nr 66 notices how his defender notices the deep cut and nr 66 being inactive, so he is ready to poach off and help deep, but then nr 66 counters and does a under cut to drag the defender away, leaving nr 15 uncontested deep.

This is something we should start thiniking about as well, especially on end zone plays. If you are/are about to be poached, you need to do something to get the poach to react. Its usually going into the other direction from where they want to, but most important is to simply not stay inactive
