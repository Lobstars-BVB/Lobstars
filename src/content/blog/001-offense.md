This guide is split into sections by game role, handling, cutting, and by game play moment, receiving the pull, mid field offence and end zone offence.

### Receiving the pull:

**Objective: get the disc into an as advantageous position as possible for us, quickly.**

#### Handlers

Make sure to contain the pull. Contain means, make sure that the pull gets caught, or get the disc into play as soon as possible.
Recommendation: on the line, decide who is gonna catch the pull and who is gonna be ready to receive the first pass into the center of the field.

If it's a roller pull, stop the roll. No half-assed stopping if you go for stopping, make sure it stops.

#### Cutters

Get into position quickly, to clear cutting lanes for initiating cutters. Always know what's happening(don't jog with heads down to position) on the field and _be ready for a pass at all times. https://someflow.substack.com/p/be-ready-for-the-pass-at-all-times_

If it's a roller pull, stop the roll. No half-assed stopping if you go for stopping, make sure it stops.

### Midfield offence

**Objective: get the disc to the endzone (without turning over)**

#### Handlers

You are the defence of the offence. Your job is to safely keep the disc within the team, and take chances to move the disc forward.
If you are on the disc, know where the open spaces are and see early if there are any cuts developing.
If not, activate your dump and look for an easy pass.

If you are the reset handler, get into a position early, from where you can get open with one move and the thrower can confidently pass to you when you get activated.

#### Cutters

Put yourself in a position to receive passes that gets the team closer to the end zone.

See what the defence is doing and react accordingly. Zone? Tight person D? Clam? Being poached? Have a strategy for every scenario.

#### Endzone offence

**Objective: Score**

Handlers:
Take charge of the offence and don't be afraid to tell the cutters what to do. If you can not score easily because there are people everywhere in the Endzone, tell them to clear.

Handlers can also score, no need to force a throw to a cutter.

Cutters:
With little vertical space left on the field, we need to think about space as we are in or close to the end zone. Work together to not clog the end zone, to make scoring possible.

Tips: The less people in the end zone, the more space we have for scoring. If you are behind the disc when we are close to the end zone, there is no point trying to get in there with your defender, _you will just make it harder for us to score https://someflow.substack.com/p/putting-your-whole-offense-in-the_

If you are in the end zone, control what your defender is doing to clear space.
