      <h2>
        Ultimate is a non-contact, self-refereed team sport played with a flying
        disc frisbee.
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>The aim of the game-</strong> Two teams of seven players compete
        on a playing field about the same length as a football field, but narrower.
        At each end of the playing field there is an end zone. Each team defends
        one end zone. They score a goal if one of their players catches the disc
        in the opposite end zone.<br /><br />The player with the disc is called
        the thrower. The thrower may not run with the disc. Instead they move
        the disc by passing to team-mates in any direction.<br /><br />The
        defensive team gets possession of the disc if an offensive team’s throw
        is not caught by a player of the same team. Then the defensive team
        becomes the offensive team and can try to score in the opposite end
        zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spirit of the Game-</strong> Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the
        Game that places the responsibility for fair play on every player. There
        are no referees; the players are solely responsible for following and enforcing
        the rules, even at World Championship. Competitive play is encouraged, but
        never at the expense of respect between players, adherence to the rules,
        and the basic joy of play.
